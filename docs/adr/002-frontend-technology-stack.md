## Status
Accepted

## Context
Building a responsive and interactive web-based search engine interface requires:

- Type safety
- Efficient state management
- Modern UI components
- Responsive design

## Decision
Adopt the following technology stack:
- React with TypeScript
- @tanstack/react-query
- react-router-dom
- Shadcn UI with Tailwind CSS

## Rationale
1. **React**: 
   - Industry standard for building dynamic UIs
   - Component-based architecture promotes reusability
2. **TypeScript**:
   - Enhances code quality and maintainability
   - Provides better developer experience through static typing
3. **@tanstack/react-query**:
   - Simplifies data fetching and caching
   - Reduces boilerplate code
4. **react-router-dom**:
   - Standard solution for client-side routing
5. **Shadcn UI & Tailwind CSS**:
   - Provides customizable, accessible components
   - Utility-first CSS enables rapid development

## Consequences
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with the stack
- Need to maintain type definitions
- Larger bundle size compared to vanilla JS
- Requires proper project structure for maintainability
