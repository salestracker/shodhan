# ADR 003: Threaded Search Results Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The search engine needs to support:
- Conversational follow-up questions
- Contextual responses based on previous searches
- Clear visualization of conversation threads

## Decision
Implement threaded search results using:
- `SearchResult` interface with `parentId` and `replies` fields
- Context passing via `parentResult` parameter in search service
- Recursive component rendering for visualization

## Rationale
1. **User Experience**:
   - Enables natural conversation flow
   - Maintains context between queries
2. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Simple tree structure for conversation threads
   - Clear parent-child relationships
   - Flexible nesting of follow-up questions
3. **Performance**:
   - Local state management minimizes API calls
   - Efficient rendering with React's virtual DOM

## Consequences
- Increased complexity in search service
- Additional state management requirements
- Need for recursive UI components
- Potential performance impact with deep nesting
